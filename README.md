# Henryk's PICDEM projects

Here are various projects for [PICDEM Lab Development Kit][DM163045] -
Microchips Development board with 8-bit MCUs.

There are 2 programming guides for PICDEM board:
* very old using MPLAB IDE and HI-TECH C: 
  - http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/41369A.pdf
* recent using MPLAB X IDE  and XC C compiler:
  - https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/40001369C.pdf

Here are my Components created in [ExpressPCB Classic][ExpressPCB]
version 7.9.0.
To install those Custom components copy:
- `ExpressPCB\SchComponents_Custom\` to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\ExpressPCB\SchComponents_Custom\` (packages)

* https://github.com/hpaluch/temp_meter_16f630
  - temperature meter with PIC16F630, DS18B20 1-wire temp sensors and 2 segment LED display
  - moved from bitbucket.org, because they busted Mercurial SCM
* https://github.com/hpaluch/sound10f206.x
  - generate sound with 10F206
  - moved from bitbucket.org, because they busted Mercurial SCM
* https://github.com/hpaluch/motor_pic10f206
  - PIC10F206 drive motor using Software pwm
  - moved from bitbucket.org, because they busted Mercurial SCM
* https://bitbucket.org/hpaluch/pic16f88-demo.x/src/master/
  - PIC16F88 UART example - control LED from PC with Putty, requires "USB Console cable"
    (USB virtual COM port with TTL(!) pinout)
  - Assembler version

  - PIC16F206 and Software UART transmitter (only).

# List of MCUs

Officially [PICDEM Lab Development Kit][DM163045]  includes these MCUs:

* [PIC12F615][PIC12F615]
* [PIC16F616][PIC16F616]

My revised PICDEM board additionally includes these MCUs:
* [PIC10F206][PIC10F206]
* [PIC16F630][PIC16F630]
* [PIC16F690][PIC16F690]
* [PIC16F88][PIC16F88] - my favorite, has ICD (hardware debugger support)

Additionally I have also:
* [PIC16F84][PIC1684] - legend that I started with around '98 (under DOS using DIY RS232 port programmer published
  by Sam J. Engstr√∂m)
* [PIC16F819][PIC16F819]

# Notes

It was observed that pull-up resistor (value from 4.7 kOhm to 10 kOhm - as recommended by PicKit3 docs)
from `/MCRL` to `Vdd` (+5V) is *required for proper power-up startup* (especially with disconnected PicKit3)!

# Other notes

GitHub.com incorrectly parses TeX spacing characters in inline math (`$ ... $`), for example `$1 \, s$`
as reported on https://github.com/community/community/discussions/17143.
Workaround is to double `\` which however breaks TeX syntax...
